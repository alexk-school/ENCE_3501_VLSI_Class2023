## Intro

This lab focuses on using a library called muddLib07 to make a 4 bit ring counter in electric vlsi. A ring counter has only 1 bit high and cycles that position each clock cycle. The ring counter will be made using Inverters, XOR gates, and D flip flops. The ring counter for this lab will feature a falling edge input and an active low clear.

## ELECTRIC VLSI

### Rules

A copy of VLSI settings used can be found in [/electricProject/electricPrefs.xml](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexk-school/ENCE_3501_VLSI_Class2023/main/FinalProject/electricProject/electricPrefs.xml) Keep in mind that this includes simulation settings. This lab was made using [sCMOS sub micron rules](http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/class/ece224a/sCMOS/sCMOS-main.html) with a Î» of 300 nm.

All mosfets will be simulated as long channel.

### MuddLib07

This lab will be done using a library called [muddLib07.jelib](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexk-school/ENCE_3501_VLSI_Class2023/main/FinalProject/electricProject/muddLib07.jelib) Modifications will be shown below.

This lab will use **xor2_1x**, **inv_1x**, and **flopr_c_1x** from muddlib07. **flopr_c_1x** is an active low reset D flip flop. All of these files have been modified to include a text file for compiling into LTSpice, along with assigning each cmos to a model name (See [Simulation](#simulation)). **flopr_c_1x** has been modified to include a **!q** output. This was placed before the inverter that creates **q**.

The flips flops in muddLib07 have two clock inputs **ph1** and **ph2**. When both are high **d** will be connected to **q**. For rising edge behavior the the clock for **ph2** should be the inverse of **ph1**. To achieve falling edge, invert the **ph1** signal and then invert **ph1** for **ph2**.

### Ring Counter

## Simulation

The simulations is using 5V long channel models. This is done using the 1 um CMOS models from the file [/LTSpice/cmosedu_models.txt](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexk-school/ENCE_3501_VLSI_Class2023/main/FinalProject/LTSpice/cmosedu_models.txt)
